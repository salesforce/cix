# CIX {docsify-ignore-all}

## What is CIX?

CIX (Continuous Integration Executor) is a containerized pipeline solution with the goal of consistent, reproducible executions. CIX currently supports execution via the Docker container engine. CIX is platform independent and allows users to quickly migrate their pipelines between CI solutions. While CIX was originally built to be CI (Continuous Integration) focused, it can be used for any other purpose where a containerized pipeline solution is required.
